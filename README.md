## Getting Started

__The project is based on [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and was tested with v10.15__. Newer versions can apparently cause problems with some of the dependencies - I'm working on resolving this soon.
To install the necessary packages, run this command in the root folder of the site:

```
npm install
```

__Commands__  

* Run `npm start` for a development server and live reloading
* Run `npm run build` to generate a production build
